/**
 * types.ts — Data model for the block editor.
 *
 * This file defines the shape of every piece of data that the editor stores.
 * Keeping types in a dedicated file (rather than scattered across components)
 * has several advantages:
 *   - Single source of truth: change a type here and TypeScript will flag every
 *     component that needs updating.
 *   - Easier persistence: these types map directly to what you'd store in a
 *     database or serialize to JSON.
 *   - Cleaner imports: components import exactly the types they need.
 *
 * ─── DESIGN DECISIONS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHY a discriminated union for BlockContent instead of a single object type?
 *   Each block type has a completely different content shape (a text block stores
 *   HTML string; a code block stores { code, language }). A union models this
 *   accurately and allows TypeScript to narrow the type in component render logic.
 *
 * WHY are type guards functions (isTextBlockContent, etc.) instead of `instanceof`?
 *   The content types are plain objects / primitives — they don't have class
 *   constructors, so `instanceof` can't be used. Runtime key-presence checks
 *   (the `'code' in content` pattern) are the idiomatic JavaScript alternative.
 *
 * WHY pass `type: BlockType` to the type guards?
 *   Without the `type` parameter, `'code' in content` alone can't distinguish a
 *   CodeBlockContent from a DiagramBlockContent (both have a `code` key). The
 *   block's `type` field is the authoritative discriminant.
 *
 * IMPROVEMENT IDEAS:
 *   - Add a `createdAt: number` / `updatedAt: number` to Block for history tracking.
 *   - Add a `tags: string[]` to Page for categorisation.
 *   - Add a `VideoBlockContent` with url + captions.
 *   - Consider using a schema validation library (Zod) to parse untrusted data
 *     (e.g. from a database or API) into these types safely.
